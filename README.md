# 📚 LearnFlow

LearnFlow is a full-stack web application that helps learners organize all their learning resources in one place. Instead of keeping YouTube videos, documentation, articles, PDFs, and coding problems scattered across different platforms, users can group them into collections, track their understanding, and receive personalized revision reminders based on their confidence level.

The project is designed to make self-learning more organized, consistent, and efficient.

# 💡 Motivation

Many learners save resources across multiple platforms—YouTube, blogs, documentation, coding websites, and PDFs—but often forget where they saved them or when to revisit them.

LearnFlow addresses this by providing a centralized platform where users can organize resources, track their understanding, and receive simple spaced-review reminders to reinforce learning.

---

# 🎯 Future Scope

- PostgreSQL support
- Docker deployment
- Cloud file storage
- Email reminders
- AI-generated flashcards
- AI learning recommendations
- Mobile application
